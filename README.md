## Procedural Pixel Art Generator Plug-in
When you click generate, pixels will randomly be erased or filled, with their opacity being the chance of generating(staying).
<p>Clicking 'Generate This Layer' will only use the active layer as input, 'Generate All' will use all available layers and flatten the output 
<p>Use the X and Y checkboxes to determine if generation will be symmetrical along one axis or both.</p>
<p>The outline checkbox will determine if the output is outlined in the active foreground color, the outline button will outline the currently active layer.
<p>The stray pixels checkbox will determine if lone pixels will be removed from the output
<p>Layers that are locked or not visible will not be affected, or layers with no pixel data(such as groups).</p>
<p>The variations box will determine the number of times the generation will run, and thus the number of different results.
<p>Multiple layers will be combined(base,mid,top,etc) and will be flattened and output to a new layer called 'Variation #' in the 'Output(s)' folder.
