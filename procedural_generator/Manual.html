<h1>Procedural Pixel Art Generator</h1>
<p>Allows for procedural generation of images/sprites.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>When you click generate, pixels will randomly be erased or filled, with their opacity being the chance of generating(staying).</p>
<p>Use the X and Y checkboxes to determine if generation will be symmetrical along one axis or both.</p>
<p>Layers that are locked or not visible will not be affected, or layers with no pixel data(such as groups).</p>
